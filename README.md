## Overview

We propose a **multi-task learning (MTL)** framework that jointly trains a constituency parser and a semantic dependency parser for **low-resource languages**, with a particular focus on **Urdu**.

The system leverages shared representations to benefit from syntactic-semantic correlations, resulting in improved generalization and performance in both tasks.

This is the **first publicly available dataset and parser for joint syntactic-semantic analysis in Urdu**.

## Key Features

- Joint learning of constituency and semantic parsing  
- Uses gold-standard and weakly labeled corpora for Urdu  
- Model variants with ELMo, GloVe, and Word2Vec embeddings  
- Evaluation on labeled F1-score and semantic parsing accuracy  
- Supports multitask optimization with hard and soft parameter sharing

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Urdu syntactic & semantic datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ mtl_parser.py # Main multitask parser code
â”œâ”€â”€ labels2brackets.py # Utility for converting to bracketed format
â”œâ”€â”€ tree2.py # Semantic tree conversion script

## Dataset

The datasets are based on:

- A syntactic corpus built from Urdu Treebank-style annotations  
- A grammatical role labeling structure using Urdu PropBank-style structures  

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- TensorFlow or Keras (for model training)  
- NLTK  
- NumPy, SciPy, and other common NLP libraries  

```bash
# Install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the Parser
python mtl_parser.py

# Evaluation
python labels2brackets.py      # Converts predicted parse trees  
python tree2.py                # Converts semantic parses  
```
